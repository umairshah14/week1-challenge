# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Your Task
 
**Note**: Be sure to review the [Challenge Guide](./Challenge-Guide.md) and the [Good README Guide](./Good-README-Guide.md) before you start working on this assignment!

This week your challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. 


## What I Did

In the css file, wherever there were different css classes that had the same properties, i added them together so that there was a shorter css styling sheet

In the html file, i added a title so that it said Horeison Marketing Agency instead of "website" and i also added alts for accessibility when images dont load up or if someone is usin a screen loader.
